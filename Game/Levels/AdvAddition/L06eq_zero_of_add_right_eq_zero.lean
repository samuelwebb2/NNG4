Introduction
" We have still not proved that if `a + b = 0` then `a = 0` and also `b = 0`. Let's finish this
world by proving one of these in this level, and the other in the next.

## Two new tactics

If you have a hypothesis `h : False` then you are done, because a false statement implies
any statement. You can use the `tauto` tactic to finish your proof.

Sometimes you just want to deal with the two cases `b = 0` and `b = succ d` separately,
and don't need the inductive hypothesis `hd` that comes with `induction b with d hd`.
In this situation you can use `cases b with d` instead.

TacticDoc tauto "
# Summary

The `tauto` tactic will solve any goal which can be solved purely by logic (that is, by
truth tables).

## Example

If you have `False` as a hypothesis, then `tauto` will solve
the goal. This is because a false hypothesis implies any hypothesis.

## Example

If your goal is `True`, then `tauto` will solve the goal.

## Example

If you have two hypotheses `h1 : a = 37` and `h2 : a ≠ 37` then `tauto` will
solve the goal because it can prove `False` from your hypotheses, and thus
prove the goal (as `False` implies anything).

## Example

If you have a hypothesis of the form `a = 0 → a * b = 0` and your goal is `a * b ≠ 0 → a ≠ 0`, then
`tauto` will solve the goal, because the goal is logically equivalent to the hypothesis.
If you switch the goal and hypothesis in this example, `tauto` would solve it too.

TacticDoc cases "
## Summary

If `n` is a number, then `cases n with d` will break the goal into two goals,
one with `n = 0` and the other with `n = succ d`.

If `h` is a proof (for example a hypothesis), then `cases h with...` will break the
proof up into the pieces used to prove it.

## Example

If `h : a ≤ b` is a hypothesis, then `cases h with c hc` will create a new number `c`
and a proof `hc : b = a + c`. This is because the *definition* of `a ≤ b` is
`∃ c, b = a + c`.

## Example

If `n : ℕ` is a number, then `cases n with d` will break the goal into two goals,
one with `n` replaced by 0 and the other with `n` replaced by `succ d`. This
corresponds to the mathematical idea that every natural number is either `0`
or a successor.

## Example

If `h : P ∨ Q` is a hypothesis, then `cases h with hp hq` will turn one goal
into two goals, one with a hypothesis `hp : P` and the other with a
hypothesis `hq : Q`.
