`add_left_comm a b c` is a proof that `a + (b + c) = b + (a + c)`.

Introduction "Having to rearrange variables manually using commutativity and
associativity is very tedious. We start by reminding you of this. `add_left_comm`
is a key component in the first algorithm which we'll explain, but we need
to prove it manually.

Remember that you do precision commutativity rewriting
with things like `rw [add_comm b c]`. And remember that
`a + b + c` means `(a + b) + c`.
